"""
In this assignment you must write a phone book. This should be a
console-based application. The user can create a new contact by
name and phone number, find the contact by name, update the contact
by name and delete it by name. Data must be saved in a pickle file.
Divide your application into two modules, one for working with data and
one for the user interface. Please note that the data module
must not contain print () / input () functions.
